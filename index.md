# CSC 254 – Object-Oriented Programming

*A deeper look into Java, classes, objects, modularity, and real program design.*

Welcome to CSC 254. This course builds directly on the introductory Java knowledge from CSC 187 and develops the skills needed to design real software in a multi-class, object-oriented environment.

The book you are reading is the primary source of knowledge for the course. Each lesson is intentionally written so that:

- Experienced programmers will find the explanations clear and worthwhile
- Students who struggled in CSC 187 can understand every concept from the ground up
- Concepts tie together into a unified picture of *what object-oriented programming actually is*
- Syntax, examples, diagrams, and definitions appear exactly where they are needed

This book is also the reference for exercises, autograded assignments, and interview milestones.

### What You Will Learn

By the end of the course, you will understand:

- How objects actually work in Java: memory, references, fields, constructors
- How to design and encapsulate classes cleanly
- How classes relate through composition, association, and inheritance
- How polymorphism works and why it matters
- How collections and generics enable large-scale program structure
- How to recognize and apply standard design patterns
- How to design programs that are maintainable, modular, and correct
- How to test, debug, and reason about software quality
